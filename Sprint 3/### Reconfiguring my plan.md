### Reconfiguring my plan


1. OK, I need to abandon the idea that I am going to launch autoscaling initially. I think I need to focus on launching all of the resources and then going through the console to set up autoscaling. It is doable in CloudFormation, so I should submit the CloudFormation template that launches with autolaunch, but I am running into too many issues with how it works. I am not sure if I am going to be able to do cloudWatch or not, not sure at this point.
